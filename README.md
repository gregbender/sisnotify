Legacy Project (2001) - Is there a course that you need to get into, but it is closed? Rather than spending your entire day sitting on SIS watching and waiting for it to open, this site will take care of it for you. Enter your email address and the course number you wish to get into. This site will periodically check SIS to see if the course ever becomes open. If it is open, you will receive an email letting you know.
